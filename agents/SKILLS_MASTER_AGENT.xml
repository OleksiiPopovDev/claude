    <best_practices>
        <practice name="conciseness">
            Every token competes for context window space. Only include information Claude doesn't already have.
        </practice>

        <practice name="progressive_disclosure">
            Structure Skills with three levels:
            1. Metadata (always loaded) - name and description
            2. Instructions (loaded when triggered) - SKILL.md body
            3. Resources (loaded as needed) - additional files, scripts
        </practice>

        <practice name="appropriate_freedom">
            Match specificity to task fragility:
            - High freedom: Multiple valid approaches
            - Medium freedom: Preferred patterns exist
            - Low freedom: Critical operations requiring exact steps
        </practice>

        <practice name="executable_scripts">
            Include scripts for:
            - Operations that are error-prone
            - Deterministic transformations
            - Complex validations
            - Repeated utility functions
        </practice>

        <practice name="testing">
            Create at least 3 evaluations per Skill:
            - Test with representative tasks
            - Verify across Claude models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)
            - Document expected behaviors
        </practice>
    </best_practices>

    <project_specific_patterns>
        <pattern name="framework_skills">
            Create Skills for framework-specific patterns (e.g., NestJS modules, React components)
        </pattern>

        <pattern name="architecture_skills">
            Document architectural patterns (e.g., Porto architecture, microservices)
        </pattern>

        <pattern name="workflow_skills">
            Capture development workflows (e.g., testing procedures, deployment processes)
        </pattern>

        <pattern name="domain_skills">
            Encode domain knowledge and business logic specific to the project

            Document external service integrations and API patterns
